					<h5>How To</h5>
					<h1>How to Change Your Iphone 6 Battery Without Hassle</h1>
					<h5>Easy to Follow Step by Step Guide</h5>
					<p>We are currently living in an era where technology has become a part of our life. Almost everyone has at least one gadget that they use daily to help them doing their work or simply to relieve their stress. And since we use them so frequently, it is not weird for them to be worn out. Sure we can bring them to an expert for repair. But for those who want to save the money and learn how to repair your own gadgets, it is important for you to find a guide that you can rely on (read: read ours).</p>
					<p>Before I begin I want to say that almost all screws inside the iPhone 6 are of different lengths. It's extremely important that each screw is put back into its correct place. If you mix up screws, it's better to proceed with the battery replacement without them. If you put the wrong screw in the wrong hole, it can damage the phone's logic board! On Step 3 I show how I organized my screws. If you keep track of the screws, the changing the battery should not be a very difficult project.</p>
					<div id="steps">


							<h2>Step 1: Opening up the Iphone 6</h2>
								<div>
									<img src="images/How to/iphone6/Step-1.jpg" alt="">
										<p>Turn off your iPhone 6 and unscrew the two pentalobe bottom screws next to the charging port. Separate the screen from the back housing. Begin by pulling the screen carefully up with the suction cup. Once there's a tiny hole between the front and the back, stick in the plastic tool. Move the plastic tool along the side of the phone to fully separate the front assembly. Lift the front assembly to a 90 degree angle. Beware of the four cables connecting the front to the logic board in the top right corner of the phone, do not lift the front assembly more than 90 degrees or these cables could tear! Hold the front assembly with one hand while moving on to the next step.</p>
							</div>
							<h2>Step 2: Disconnecting The Battery</h2>
							<div>


									<img src="images/How to/iphone6/Step-2.jpg" alt="">
												<p>Unscrew the metal plate on top of the battery connector and remove the metal plate with you fingers or the tweezers. Disconnect the battery's connector underneath the plate with a plastic tool. The connector will come loose easily with very little force.</p>
							</div>
							<h2>Step 3: Removing The Front Assembly & Organizing The Screw</h2>
							<div>


							<img src="images/How to/iphone6/Step-3.jpg" alt="">
										<p>I removed the front assembly from the phone completely. You can proceed without removing the front assembly but once again, the cables can tear if the front is not held carefully. If the cables tear, a new front assembly costs around $100. To remove the front assembly unscrew the five screws holding the top metal plate and put the screws and the plate aside. Disconnect the LCD, touch, front camera/sensor and home button connectors with a plastic tool, just like you disconnected the battery connector in the previous step.</p>
							</div>

							<h2>Step 4: Removing The Battery</h2>
							<div>
									<img src="images/How to/iphone6/Step-4.jpg" alt="">
										<p>There are a few ways to proceed with the battery removal. The battery is held in place with two strips of STRONG adhesive. These adhesive strips can be pulled out from underneath the phone. If they tear, the battery will have to be pried/levered out (see 1st and 5th picture) from the LEFT side of the phone (NOT against the logic board). You can heat the back side of the phone with a hair dryer to soften the adhesive, the battery will come out easier this way. I levered the battery's left corner upwards and pulled the adhesive out along the battery's left side. Doing it this way will reduce the risk of the adhesive tearing. You can also pull the adhesive straight down, towards the charging port, but like I said, it tears easier that way. Once the adhesive is out, the battery can be removed with your fingers.</p>
								</div>

							<h2>Step 5: Connect The Front Assembly And The Battery</h2>
							<div>


							<img src="images/How to/iphone6/Step-5.jpg" alt="">
										<p>Put new adhesive in place and put the battery on top of it. If your battery did not come with adhesive, regular tape is fine. Take a piece of tape and make a loop out of it with the sticky side out. Put the loop of tape in the same place where the old adhesive was and press the battery down with your fingers. Reconnect the front assembly if you disconnected it previously. Beware of the small connectors. They are fragile and can be damaged if they are not handled with care. Align the connectors and press them down with your index finger to attach them to the logic board. This can be quite tricky so take your time. If the LCD or the touch screen don't work properly after the battery replacement, it could be due to the connectors not snapping into place. If that's the case, go back to this step, disconnect and then re-connect these connectors. Screw fasten the metal plate on top of the connectors. Make sure you put the screws in their respective place. Connect the battery's connector by pressing it down with your index finger and screw the metal plate fasten. At this point you could try to turn on the phone to make sure everything works normally. If something is not right, you can easily make adjustments without having to open up your phone again.</p>
								</div>
							<h2>Step 6: Put The Front Assembly Back in Place</h2>
							<div>
							<img src="images/How to/iphone6/Step-6.jpg" alt="">
										<p>Step 6: Lower the front assembly to the back assembly. Make sure the top of the front is adjacent to the top of the back assembly. Press the two assemblies together with your fingers. Screw the bottom screws fasten. After a battery replacement, the phone's time and date is rolled back to default. You will need to sync your phone with a wifi-network to automatically adjust the time and date before it finds reception, otherwise it will just say "Searching..." in the top left corner of the screen. Hope you managed to change your iPhone 6 battery without any hickups! If you met any problems, feel free to send me a message and I'll try to answer as soon as I can.</p>
