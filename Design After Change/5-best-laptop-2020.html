					<h1>5 Best Laptops of 2020</h1>
					<h5>Find The Right Laptop For Your Needs</h5>
					<p>Laptops. There’s just so many of them. But what's the best laptop for you? Is it a business notebook, a powerful gaming laptop or a Chromebook? We know the sheer number of choices can be overwhelming, which is why we made this list.</p>
					<p>We've created this handy-dandy guide so you'll know all the ins and outs of your prospective system before you make the decision to hit the buy button. From advice on choosing screen size, to selecting between an SSD and HDD to insider scoops on where to find the best prices on laptops, here are some essential tips for finding the right system for you.</p>
					<h2>The Best Laptop Right Now</h2>
					<p>The Dell XPS 13 is currently our top overall pick for best laptops. Powered by a 10th Gen Intel Core i7 processor and integrated graphics, the 1080p version of the laptop is ideal for work, play and light content creation. And with it’s bright, vivid display, the laptop is also great for watching videos. Plus, it’s also incredibly slim and light making it an ideal laptop for mobile professionals.</p>
					<p>For our Apple aficionados, you can’t beat the MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019). The successor to the 15-inch MacBook, this new laptop supplies the same powerful performance, Mac lovers have come to expect. However, Apple has made some much-needed changes, namely with the keyboard, switching out the much-maligned Butterfly keyboard for the highly-lauded Magic Keyboard.</p>
					<p>Those in the market for gaming laptops need to take a look at the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, the latest entrant into the 5 star club. Powered by an AMD APU, not only does the laptop pack a punch in the gaming department, it’s also a powerful multitasker. And with over 11 hours of battery life, it’s the longest-lasting gaming laptop ever.</p>
					<p>See our picks for best laptops below</p>

					<p>But rest assured, the laptop is just as pretty as it is powerful. The company managed to make a laptop that's smaller and lighter than previous models. Despite the smaller size, Dell added some big changes, including a larger trackpad and keyboard. Plus, you get the a 13.4-inch, near-bezeless display on every side –– the first in the world to do so.</p>

					<h2>2. MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019)</h2>
					<p>The 16-inch MacBook Pro is just your type if you’ve been waiting for Apple to make a better keyboard.

The 11 hours of battery life is another plus on this laptop, dwarfing the runtimes of its competitors.

					<h2>3. Acer Swift 3 (2020, AMD Ryzen 7 4700U)</h2>
					<p>The AMD version of the Acer Swift 3 is really the little laptop that could. Armed with an AMD Ryzen 7 4700U processor and Radeon Graphics, the Swift 3 is taking on the likes of the MacBook Pro 13 and the XPS 13 with aplomb. And it's doing that for less than $700. And if you're curious, it smoked its Intel-powered counterpart as well.</p>
					<p>The laptop served up surprising power on our benchmarks including overall and graphics performance. Plus, it has staying power with over 11 hours of battery life. Plus, it's got premium good looks and a rather comfortable keyboard. The laptop does have one flaw however, it's display which isn't as bright as we would like. But for the price, it's a minor quibble for a sub-$700 laptop that can best some of the most premium laptops on the market. With a herculean processor that whizzes past all its competitors, the Acer Swift 3 certainly earned its spot on this list</p>

					<h2>4. Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch</h2>
					<p>It's not the huge leap forward that you wanted, but it is the incremental changes that you needed. So while it's true that the latest MacBook Pro isn't the 14-inch beauty that had been rumored, it's still got a lot going for it. Number one, Apple has doubled the amount of storage you can get with every configuration. Number two, the company has closed the chapter on the much-maligned Butterfly keyboard in favor of the highly-lauded Magic keyboard.</p>
					<p>Making the jump to a 10th Gen Intel processor, the 13-inch MacBook Pro held its own against top-rated competitors in the competitive premium laptop space and even excelled. The system proved itself as a top-ranked laptop with great performance, lightning-fast transfer speeds and over 10 hours of battery life. It's a solid upgrade that Mac fans will appreciate.</p>
