     The AMD version of the Acer Swift 3 is really the little laptop that could. Armed with an AMD Ryzen 7 4700U processor and Radeon Graphics, the Swift 3 is taking on the likes of the MacBook Pro 13 and the XPS 13 with aplomb. And it's doing that for less than $700. And if you're curious, it smoked its Intel-powered counterpart as well</p></div>

   The 16-inch MacBook Pro is just your type if you’ve been waiting for Apple to make a better keyboard. The Magic Keyboard on this premium laptop ditches the Butterfly mechanism in favor of scissor switches, and the result is a much more comfortable typing experience. You also get a bright and sharp 16-inch display with slimmer bezels, powerful performance from an available Core i9 CPU and robust AMD Radeon 5300M or 5500M graphics.

     While lower-end models of this late-summer Comet Lake revamp to the XPS 13 started shipping in August, the models that arrive on Oct. 1 feature 6-core (or hexacore) Core i7 processors. Intel's promised decent gains against the 9th gen models, of about 16 percent</p>

<h1> The best laptops right now</h1>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 is currently our top overall pick for best laptops. Powered by a 10th Gen Intel Core i7 processor and integrated graphics, the 1080p version of the laptop is ideal for work, play and light content creation. And with it’s bright, vivid display, the laptop is also great for watching videos. Plus, it’s also incredibly slim and light making it an ideal laptop for mobile professionals. 

For our Apple aficionados, you can’t beat the MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019). The successor to the 15-inch MacBook, this new laptop supplies the same powerful performance, Mac lovers have come to expect. However, Apple has made some much-needed changes, namely with the keyboard, switching out the much-maligned Butterfly keyboard for the highly-lauded Magic Keyboard. 

Those in the market for gaming laptops need to take a look at the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, the latest entrant into the 5 star club. Powered by an AMD APU, not only does the laptop pack a punch in the gaming department, it’s also a powerful multitasker. And with over 11 hours of battery life, it’s the longest-lasting gaming laptop ever. 

Honorable mentions include the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook, an absolutely beautiful laptops that comes up short on the battery life. There's also the Dell Precision 7540, a bonafide workhorse with premium specs and prices to match.  </p>

          <h3>Macs with Apple CPUs will get advanced macOS Big Sur boot options</h3>
<p> Apple announced its plans to launch Macs and MacBooks running on its own processors – rather than using Intel – at WWDC 2020, and it’s now revealed some of the advanced macOS Big Sur boot options that these new machines will benefit from.

As Wccftech reports, Apple hosted a WWDC session called ‘Explore the new system architecture of Apple Silicon Macs' where it explained some of the benefits that Macs and MacBooks running on Apple Silicone will have compared to Apple computers running on Intel hardware.

          <h3>The Dell XPS 13’s</h3>
          <p>The Dell XPS 13’s impeccable design, excellent display and sheer power under its thin and light hood have kept it in the best laptops and Ultrabooks lists for years. In 2020, it continues this tradition of delivering sheer power in a truly portable laptop that looks and feels great. Only this time, it’s even better with much-needed improvements like even thinner bezels and an innovative webcam.

However, the competition is getting tougher every single year, and sadly, the Dell XPS 13 (2020) now comes with a higher price tag. For a Dell XPS 13 configuration with an Intel Ice Lake Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, you have to spend $1,249 (₤1,399, AU$2,499).

That price is certainly starting to approach Apple's levels. The 13-inch MacBook Pro with equivalent components to the XPS 13’s base configuration is just a bit more expensive at $1,499 (₤1,499, AU$2,299). And, you’re getting two more Thunderbolt 3 ports along with a QHD display.</p>

The device features two cores, a power dissipation of only 5W and a maximum Turbo frequency of 3.4GHz (up from 1.1GHz). Such a low TDP means the system can forgo the fan and rely solely on the heatsink, making for a beautifully quiet experience.

The hardware components are admittedly unspectacular (4GB RAM and 128GB SSD), but with a 14-inch TN full HD matte panel, 802.11ac and a decent array of ports (audio jack, three USB ports, an HDMI connector and a microSD slot), the ImagineBook should cater to most use cases.
